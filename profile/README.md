# Latar Belakang 

The OcuScan project was developed to address the challenge of limited access to eye care specialists in remote areas of Indonesia. The project uses a web-based image classification system to analyze eye diseases, with the goal of improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Through this project, general practitioners or medical personnel in remote areas can use a camera to capture images of patients' eyes, which are then uploaded to the OcuScan system. The system processes the images using a classification algorithm and provides a prediction of the suspected eye disease, along with the level of accuracy. This innovative approach enables faster diagnosis and treatment, ensuring that patients in remote areas receive appropriate care for their eye conditions.
